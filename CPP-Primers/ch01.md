# Chapter 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Writing a Simple C++ Program

```cpp
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

Every program contains one or more functions with one of them being `main`.
This is the entry point and what OS will try to run the given C++ program.

Function consists of four elements: a *return type*, a *function name*,
a *parameter list*, and a *function body*. `main` is a special case, but
is defined same way.

Note that `main` has a empty list of parameters and has return type of `int`
zero. Here, `int` is a *built-in type* which the language defines for us.

Final part of the main function has the function body, which is a block of
statements surrounded by the curly braces.

Only statement in the main function is a `return` statement, which terminates
the function. Also, `return` can also be used to send a value back to the
function's caller. When a `return` statement includes a value, the value
returned must have a type that is compatible with the return type of the
function. In this case, `int` is expected.

Note that on most systems, the value returned from the `main` is indicator of
a status - return value of `0` implies success whereas any other value
specifies some sort of error.

### 1.1.1 Compiling and Executing Our Program

Compiling a program depends upon the system and the compiler used. Most
compilers expect program source code to be stored in one or more files called
*source files*. Typically, these files will end in suffixes `.cc`, `.cxx`,
`.cpp`, `.c` and so on.

Typical compiling command used in UNIX like systems will be `cc`:

```
$ cc program1.cpp
```

Or, with `g++`:

```
$ g++ program1.cpp -o program1
```

Source code named `program1.cpp` will compile into a exectuable named
`program1` or `a.out`. 

## 1.2 A First Look at Input/Output

C++ does not define any statements to do IO - instead it uses *standard
library* to provide IO. For example, `iostream` library. A stream is a sequence
of characters read from or written to an IO device.

Library defines four IO objects. To handle input, we use an object of type
`istream` named `cin` is used which is also referred to as `stdin`. To handle
output, `ostream` object named `cout` is used which is also referred to as
`stdout`. Library also defines two other `ostream` objects `cerr` and `clog`
which is used for `stderr` and logging respectively.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;

    int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
    std::cin >> num1 >> num2;
    
    std::cout   << "Sum of two numbers" 
                << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is " 
                << num1 + num2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Here, first line is a directive that tells the compiler we wish to use
`iostream` library which provides IO utilities. The name inside the `<...>`
refers to as *header* or *header* file which usually ends in `.h`. 

To write to a stream, we see the `<<` output operator. This operator takes in
two operaands: left operand must be an `ostream` object and right operand is
a value to be printed. The first statement can be broken down further.

```cpp
std::cout << "Enter two numbers:";
std::cout << std::endl;
```

Here, `std::endl` is a special value called a manipulator; it has an effect of
flushing the *buffer* associated with that device. By flushing, we ensure that
all the output the program has generated so far is actually writen to the
output stream, rather tha nsitting in memory waiting to be written.

Note, when debugging, it is common practice to write a log statement or print
statement to see the status of the program. If so, we should always flush the
stream as when program unexpectedly crashes, the output maybe left in the
buffer or memory.
