## Modules and Files

Thus far, we have assumed our code is stored in a single file.

A _module_ is a `.py` file containing a collection Python definitions and
statements.

Suppose that we `circle.py` file, we have following:

```python
pi = 3.14

def area(radius):
    return pi * (radius ** 2)

def circumference(radius):
    return 2 * pi * radius
```

Then, we can import this module from another file, say `main.py`:

```python
import circle as c

print(c.pi)
print(c.area(24))
print(c.circumference(24))
```

We can avoid having to reference imported circle name everytime we use as
follows:

```python
from circle import *

print(pi)
print(area(3))

pi = 3
print(pi)           # prints 3
print(area(3))      # same as above before pi was reassigned
```

This has the effect of creating bindings within the current scope for all
objects defined within `circle`.

## Handling File I/O

Every OS has its own way of handling files; Python provides an OS independent
means to access files using a _file handler_:

```python
fileHandle = open('test.txt', 'w')

for line in fileHandle:
    print(line)

fileHandle.close()
```

Above will create a file named `test.txt` if it does not exist, and returns
file handle which we can name and thus reference. `w` indicates that the file
is available for write.
