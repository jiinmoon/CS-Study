## Towers of Hanoi

We can use recursion to reduce the complexity of some problem - where recursion
would be easier to approach the problem with.

```
Suppose there are 3 tall spikes which has 64 different sized discs - starting
on one spike. We need to move entire stack to second stack. We may move only
one disc at a time and a larger disc can never cover up a smaller disc.
```

We want to move n number of discs from one spike to another. Thinking
recursively, we can see that we first move the smaller stack of discs to one
spike, move the bottom disc to target spke and then move the smaller stack on
top of target spike. This is a recursive definition since we repeat this
process until we have a single disc leftover - our base case.

```python
def toh(n, from, to, spare):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Moved {from} to {to}")
    else:
        toh(n - 1, from, spare, to)
        toh(1, from, to, spare)
        toh(n - 1, spare, to, from)
```

## Fibonacci Numbers

```python
def fibRecur(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

Thinking recursively, we know that at every n-th iteration of the fibonacci
number depends upon the result of the two previous iterations. Hence, until we
reach our base case, we recursively call to explore all possible smaller subset
of the problems.

## Palindrome Checking

We may also check whether given string is a palindrome or not using recursive
approach.

```python
def isPalindromeRecur(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return True
    return s[0] == s[-1] and isPalindromeRecur(s[1:-1])
```

## Divide-and-Conquer

Examples we have seen thus far are the examples of a "divide-and-conquer"
algorithms where we would solve the hard problem by breaking into subproblems
such that:

- subproblems are easier to solve.
- solutions of subproblems can be combined to give final solution.
